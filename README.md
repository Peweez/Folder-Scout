# my-smart-pc

Welcome traveller,
don't get distressed by the name of the project. The name for now have pretty less to do with what this project is all about. Just read on. We can say I couldn't get the time in the past to work on a project where I can play around with the new technologies currently available on the market and use them in a purpose I need them to reach my personal goals. Anyways if the result won't be a load of crap and I can say for my self that I made a significant skill raise and learned the `good` as the `bad` things, the `easy` and the `hard` ones. I think already at this state I can talk about a good experience.  
Afterall one question I owe those who at least red until here. _Why do I do this all?_ I mean for people who know me this would be a pretty legit question. I often just play computer games in my spare time. The answer is just simple as that: _I will have a long enough period of time for myself to finish "the project" or how ever I'll be able to name it in the future._ Well to be fair let's say: I wish to have the possibility to reach my learning goals and beside that I can use anytime to refresh my mind by playing some computer games or go out for a walk. I made the experience that this switches between activities where you need to use your brain on a high level will hold you active and concentrated. Software Development is a never ending story and many of us wants the end however. :watch: :watch: :watch: :watch: 

Feel free to contact with either simple, hate, love or confused posts / pm's =) you're welcome at anytime
